#Design Considerations taken while building this app.


##FirstScreen
- The screen below represents the initial screen of the app. The overall idea was to create an app which was fast and easy to navigate as the end goal of an app is to make it really easy for the user to find and buy something. 
- The initial screen represents the background as "Ripples" as in the ripples that are being created by Zappos.

##Product Page - Intital 
- The below screen is shown when the user enters in the app.
- The user is greeted with a simple card on the screen which provides the user with a "Call To Action".
- The icon used here is deliberately made to look like it's smiling as it gives a positive affirmation to that action.
- The "Search Icon" is placed at it's usual position to reduce the learning curve of the app and also to provide familiarity.
- Also, the floating action button is invisible as of now.

##Product Page - With search results
- The below screen is shown to the user when they search for a product.
- In the Zappos API, the productName is sometimes returned with special charachters and numbers - which is offputting for the user. So while displaying the productName, I remove irrelevant charachters.
- "Add to Cart"  animation on Floating Action Button is very important as it gives the user a sense of accomplishment, so I have made the animation smooth and subtle.
- Also the animation provides with a nice feedback for an action by the user.
- "Sharing" functionality is provided, so that the users can share different products and get an opinion which is very important.
- The cost of the product is highlighted to provide the user with a better visibility.
